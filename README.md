# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

About
 This project's purpose was to optimze it for speed. The strategy was to optimize the critical rendering path and making the pages render as fast as we could on mobile and desktop. Majority of the methods were learned from classes that were taken specifically from this project and earlier classes.

 1) Inline Critical CSS - Avoided rendering blocking CSS
 2) Image Compression - reduced the sizes of the pictures
 3) Decreased download to reduce loading time
